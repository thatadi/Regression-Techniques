# Regression-Techniques
# Linear and Multiple Regression Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains code and analysis for performing linear and multiple regression on two different datasets: one created manually with synthetic X and Y values, and the other involving the 'Advertising' dataset to predict sales based on advertising expenditures.

## Files Included
1. `dataset.csv`:
   - Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis for linear regression on a manually created dataset with X and Y values.

2. `Advertising.csv`:
   - Jupyter notebook showcasing multiple regression on the 'Advertising' dataset to predict sales based on advertising expenditures.

## Manual Dataset (Linear Regression)
The `Manual_Data_Regression.ipynb` notebook demonstrates linear regression on a dataset created manually. The dataset comprises simple X and Y values (e.g., X: 12345, Y: 34245). This analysis explores the relationship between these variables and performs regression analysis to predict Y based on X.

## Advertising Dataset (Multiple Regression)
The notebook focuses on multiple regression using the 'Advertising' dataset. This dataset includes information on advertising expenditures across different channels (TV, radio, newspaper) and corresponding sales figures. The multiple regression analysis aims to predict sales based on the advertising spending across various channels.

## Dependencies
- Python (3.x)
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed.
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or Colab.
4. Run the cells sequentially to observe the analysis, visualizations, and regression results.

## Acknowledgments
- The 'Advertising' dataset used for multiple regression analysis is sourced from Kaggle
- References to online resources and documentation for the regression techniques used in the analysis.

## Notes
- The code and analysis in these notebooks are for demonstration purposes and can be used as a starting point for understanding linear and multiple regression techniques.
